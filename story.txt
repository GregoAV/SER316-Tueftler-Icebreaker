The adventure began at the Flughafen (Airport), where I accidentally grabbed a suitcase that had the exact same logo as my daughter's bag, only to discover that it was entirely stuffed with Minions toys. Due to my shock, I dropped the suitcase, spilling the toys all over the terminal and the commotion caught the attention of a very curious hund (dog). The hund dashed over to me and ripped all the Minion toys, getting fluff all over my lederhose (Leather pants).
I grabbed a Dirndel (Traditional Dress) and smacked the hund but he didn't stop so I tried to tempt him with some Gebaeck (Pastries) from the local Baeckerei (Bakery). I decided the next logical step was to try tempting the distracted hund (dog) with a greasy Bratwurst (Grilled sausage) and a slice of delicious Apfelkuchen (Apple cake) that I found in my tiny emergency backpack, hoping the scents would make him drop the lederhose (Leather pants). Noticing that the hund was showing a profound interest in the brautwurt,I decided to rush towards the nearest window and threw the aromatic sausage into a near by Porsche convertible.
We grabbed our things and leapt out of the window into a BMW, peeling out and speeding onto the Hauptstrasse (Main Street) before anyone could react.
