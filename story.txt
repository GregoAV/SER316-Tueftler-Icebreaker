The adventure began at the Flughafen (Airport), where I accidentally grabbed a suitcase that had the exact same logo as my daughter's bag, only to discover that it was entirely stuffed with Minions toys. Due to my shock, I dropped the suitcase, spilling the toys all over the terminal and the commotion caught the attention of a very curious hund (dog).
